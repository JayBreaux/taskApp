### Added

- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open source project CHANGELOG.

 - Added in a task controller with corresponding service and supporting framework
   to handle CRUD api requests, adding bulk lists of task data, getting tasks
   per user who put them in and requesting a subset of data.
